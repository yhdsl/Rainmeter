Usage:

[MeasureTimer]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=Timer
Update=1000
CountAction=[!UpdateMeasure #CurrentSection#]
FinishAction=


Bangs:

Start
Start the timer from 0.

Start_(startvalue)_(endvalue)@(step) , startvalue and endvalue can't below 0, step can below 0 and will be saved for next Bang
e.g. Start_1_255@1		from 1 to 255 by 1, then stop and execute the FinishAction
e.g. Start_255_0@-1	from 255 to 0 by 1, then stop and execute the FinishAction, equals to Start_255@-1
e.g. Start_0.1_1.0@0.1

Continue
If the timer has been started then continue,or the timer will be started from 0.
The format is the same as "Start".
The difference is that "Start" will always change the return value but "Continue" not.

Stop
Stop the timer
